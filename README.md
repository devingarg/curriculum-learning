## Datasets
- CIFAR 100: Available [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- CBIS-DDSM (Breast Cancer Detection dataset): Available [here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22516629)

## Techniques
We implement data-level curricula to train the network. Variants of these curricula:
1. Based on rarity
2. Based on feature clustering
